// directly for this purpose, as we can't give it a lexer and indentation level,
// so we introduce a helper function that does track that data.
//
// We return bool to indicate whether parsing an expression succeded.  We don't
// throw an exception for that, as it isn't an error situation: when we're
// parsing the arguments to a function, at some point we'll run into the closing
// brace, which means we have all the arguments and continue.

/* When the lexer reaches the end of file, it will emit an eof token before
 * going into a bad state.  It would be convenient to check only for this token,
 * instead of also having to check the lexer state all the time.
 *
 * Unfortunately, there may be a bug in the code leading to one of these
 * functions being called when the eof has already been extracted.  If we don't
 * check the state, such a bug would lead to failures when we try to use the
 * values, which could happen significantly later than the read itself, and
 * which would likely be hard to fix.
 *
 * To detect such programmer errors, we can use the standard assert facility.
 * The syntax is like a function call:
 *
 *      assert(expression);
 *
 * If the expression evaluates to true, nothing happens.  However, if the
 * expression is false, the program will exit and an error message will be
 * displayed.
 *
 * assert may look like a function, but it isn't one.  There is, for example, a
 * way to disabling asserts, so that the statement is ignored entirely and the
 * expression is not evaluated at all.
